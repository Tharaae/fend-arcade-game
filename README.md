This project is an implementation of the basic Classic Arcade game functionality. JS ES6 is used.

**The game steps is as follows:**

- To start the game, run the index.html file in the browser.
- In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
- The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
- The player can move left, right, up and down using keyboard arrows. 
- The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. 
- If a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the grass area. 
- Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
- On winning, a modal essage is displayed congratulaing the player and asking if they like to play again or not.
- If the player will not play again, the game stops at where they won the game.
- If the player chose to play again, the game is reset and restarted.
